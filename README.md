# JKSSB - Jammu And Kashmir Services Selection Board Aspirants

# October 2022
1. Oct-2022- The day when I discovered SQL Injection Vuln in ssbjk.org.in and filed disclosure 
assistance on HackerOne. Before filing it I tried to contact JKSSB via phone but most of the
numbers displayed on websites were invalid and phone to rest of the numbers were not picked 
up by anyone.

# Finally i was able to get in contact with ex-board member of JKSSB Mr. Ashiq Hussain Lily And i shared the issue with him and he further converyed issue to JKSSB.

Next day i recieved a phone call from an unknown person who later proved to be Mr. Reyaz Ahmad Malik (JKAS) Controller Of Examinations JKSSB.


# Refuting IT Team of JKSSB
I sent a database sample to the Controller of Examinations JKSSB in order to refute the claim made by his IT team during our telephonic communication. Despite their assurance of system security, I wanted to provide concrete evidence to challenge their statement.

Initially Reyaz Ahmad Malik appreciated my efforts and 
said "

I requested Reyaz sb from my end to disclose the security issue but they refused and said

# Another Website
A few days later I was able to break into another website that gave me access to the whole admin panel of JKSSB leading me to access to more than 801626 Personal  information of JKSSB Aspirants that includes Phone  number, Full name , Email id and password. I reported the vulnerability and the issue was patched.

# Visiting JKSSB
On February 17, I went there and I met Abdul Raqib Bhat  (Jr. KAS ) Undersecretary JKSSB and shared my concerns. I also suggested him Full cybersecurity assessment. He  said that I will share these things with Reyaz Sb and we  will get back to you within days.

# Communication abruptly cut after 17-February-2023
I made muntiple attempts to get the update from Mr. Reyaz Ahmad Malik but recieved no response.

# It's important to note that the assurance of a reward  was not given by a low-level employee or an IT  professional at JKSSB. Instead, it was promised by a  senior KAS officer, the Controller of Examination   JKSSB, who holds significant authority within the  organization. Is this the appropriate way to treat  youth who contribute  constructively?

# Remember this: the higher your position, the more likely you are to be dishonest.
