# JKSSB - Jammu And Kashmir Services Selection Board Aspirants

# October 2022
1. Oct-2022- The day when I discovered SQL Injection Vuln in ssbjk.org.in and filed disclosure 
assistance on HackerOne. Before filing it I tried to contact JKSSB via phone but most of the
numbers displayed on websites were invalid and phone to rest of the numbers were not picked 
up by anyone.

# Finally i was able to get in contact with ex-board member of JKSSB Mr. Ashiq Hussain Lily And i shared the issue with him and he further converyed issue to JKSSB.

Next day i recieved a phone call from an unknown person who later proved to be Mr. Reyaz Ahmad Malik (JKAS) Controller Of Examinations JKSSB.


# Refuting IT Team of JKSSB
I sent a database sample to the Controller of Examinations JKSSB in order to refute the claim made by his IT team during our telephonic communication. Despite their assurance of system security, I wanted to provide concrete evidence to challenge their statement.
